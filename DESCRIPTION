Description: The libaffy C software library included a new normalization technique
 known as IRON (Iterative Rank-Order Normalization). The algorithm was shown to be
 effective at normalizing data, not just gene expression microarray data but other
 types (e.g., proteomics, metabolomics, etc) as well. It was embedded within a C
 library (libaffy) used for processing Affymetrix microarrays. The key functionality
 of that approach has been ported to R code and, while not providing identical
 output, reimplements the key IRON algorithm.
